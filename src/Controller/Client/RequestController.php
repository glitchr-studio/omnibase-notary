 * of the office in request mode (no time yet: the office fixes it), under
 * the name, the e-mail and the phone given; the few words are kept
 * encrypted, as every reason is.
 *
 * The form, its model and what is done with the request are
 * omnibase/office's (AbstractRequestController, AppointmentRequests); the
 * route, the page and its words are this regime's.
